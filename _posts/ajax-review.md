###### Deadpool & Death annual, 1998

<br/><br/>힘과 능력
Super-Strength: As the Attending, Francis possessed enhanced strength (lifting at least one ton), durability.[9]

Enhanced Reflexes: His reflexes were enhanced giving him an intuitive capacity to better predict opponents' moves.[9]

Immune to Pain: His nerves were altered to make him immune to all but the most excruciating pain levels.[9]

Further Enhancements: As Ajax, he was even stronger (Class 10 or higher) and faster, enabling him to create "sonic micro booms" by snapping his fingers, rub his hands together so rapidly that they burst into flame, and literally boil an opponent alive via friction heat

영화에서 보면, 사실 뭐 에이젝스뿐 아니라 코믹스랑 대체적으로 무게감 같은 게 다르긴 하지만, 암튼 에이젝스에 대한 분노가 딱히 크게 느껴지진 않았는데 코믹스를 보니까.. .. 똑같았다(존나 반전)
이게 그러니까 에이젝스만 겁나 화나 있음. 그게 너무 발린단 거임. 에이젝스는 "널 죽여버리겠다" 쒸익씌익거리면서 존나 달려오는데 데드풀은 그게 아니라는 게 또 하 믜츼 집착남 이건 된다.

Somehow Francis survived, and resurfaced years later as Ajax when he hunted down and killed many of the surviving members from the Weapon X project in order to exact his revenge on Deadpool. After torturing Killebrew at his mountain home in the Alps to obtain Wade's teleporter frequency, Ajax teleported Wade next to a nearby cliff and sucker-punched him, sending Deadpool to his death, again
